### Difference between Alias and Interface

- `Interface` can be extended, which means that it can be inherited, wheras `Alias` is impossible to extends other `Ailias`.

- **Typescript** recommends more using `Interface` than `Alias` to developers becasuse `extendable` is a good way to implement reusability.
